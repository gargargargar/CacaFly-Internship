# CacaFly-Internship


These are some experimental codes I wrote as a Data Analyst Intern at cacaFly, Inc. in the summer of 2018.

The meat of the project is unfortunately not part of this repository due to NDA agreements, but feel free to check out some of the fun test files I wrote while learning Shell script!
